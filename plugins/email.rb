description "Extract email addresses. Find valid email address and syntactically invalid email addresses from mailto: link tags. We match syntactically invalid links containing mailto: to catch anti-spam email addresses, eg. bob at gmail.com. This uses the simplified email regular expression from http://www.regular-expressions.info/email.html for valid email address matching."

# More Info:
# The regex will only detect anti-spam e-mail addresses if present in "mailto:"
# The regex does not validate e-mail addresses in "mailto:"
#
# Example:
# <a href="mailto:bob at gmail dot com"> will return "bob at gmail dot com"
# <p>Contact me:  bob at gmail dot com</p> will not be detected
# <p>Contact me:  bob@gmail.com</p> will return "bob@gmail.com"

# Google results as at 2011-03-19 #
# 902 for "contact me" ("@hotmail.com"|"@gmail.com"|"@yahoo.com")
